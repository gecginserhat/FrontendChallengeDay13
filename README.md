Day 13: JavaScript DOM Manipulation - The Power of the Document <br/>

🌐 Day 13 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today was all about JavaScript DOM manipulation! <br/>🚀 Here's a quick breakdown:<br/>

📄 Understanding the Document: I began by exploring how the document object in JavaScript represents the entire webpage, allowing us to interact with and modify it dynamically.<br/>

🔍 What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?: The DOM is a structured representation of the document, where every HTML element is an object. It’s the bridge that connects JavaScript to the webpage.<br/>

🔗 Document Object - Part 1 & 2: Learned how to access, update, and modify elements using the document object, such as getElementById(), querySelector(), and more.<br/>

Tomorrow, I’ll dive deeper into manipulating the DOM with events!<br/>
